# Anti-Alzheimer

## ALZHEIMER :
Alzheimer&#39;s is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.

Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is a progressive disease that affects memory and cognitive function. AD is more common in people over the age of 65, but it can also affect younger adults. Symptoms such as forgetfulness and confusion are mild during the early stages of the disease, but they gradually worsen as the disease progresses and damage to the brain becomes more severe.

**Why this app ?**

Our Mobile application will keep track of day-to-day rountine of Patient like when he got up, when goes out ,where does he go often etc. If there is huge change in the rountine of patient, warning notification will send by the application to the Patient&#39;s family members

We will collect one month data , and on basic of that data we continuously notified him/her what he/she have to do next.

We have implemented a Chatbot inside our Application , which will answer commonly asked questions by the patients. Example â€“ Who am I? , Where is Home?  Etc.

That will be very helpful for the patient.

Our Application will let patient to click photo of everyone  he/she meets. And  that,  picture with some description like name,age,relation with patient etc will be save in a Database. So that, if patient meet that particular person for the second time, and try to click his picture , a window will pop-up with the picture and description of that person.

**How Does it works ?**

We used android studio for making Android application, that application will send a request to the server to access Database, we have used Django localhost as a server and Sqlite as Database. Our server will respond in JSON format to application

For Face Recognition purpose , we have used Microsoft Azure Face API and , For Chatbot, we have used Googel API DialogFlow .

**Features:**

1. Face Recognition (Person Recognition)
2. Push Notification
3. Personal Assistant
4. Machine Learning For Tracking daily schedule
5. Security System For Out of Track patients
6. Database for Friends and acquaintances.
