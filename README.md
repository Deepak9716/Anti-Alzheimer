ALZHEIMER :
Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a progressive disease that affects memory and cognitive function. AD is more common in people over the age of 65, but it can also affect younger adults. Symptoms such as forgetfulness and confusion are mild during the early stages of the disease, but they gradually worsen as the disease progresses and damage to the brain becomes more severe.
